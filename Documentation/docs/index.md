Ubiq is a Unity networking library, for research, teaching and development.

Ubiq is built and maintained by the Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group at University College London.

Ubiq is 100% free and open source.

## Features

Ubiq's goal is to enable your networked project. It includes message passing, room management, rendezvous and matchmaking, object spawning, shared binary blobs, multiple synchronisation models, lighweight XR interaction examples, customisable avatars and voice chat across Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, and Javascript running in the browser.

## For Researchers

Instructions for setting up your own server are included. Ubiq does not rely on any third-party services, making it GDPR-safe for your experiments.
