## MkDocs Commands

This page is for the Ubiq developers. 

This documentation is generated with MkDocs. For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

To keep linking between pages simple, try to keep all MD files in the docs/ directory. Images should be placed in images/ and all filenames should be GUIDS. Please delete images if you remove a reference to them. The exception is reusable assets such as logos, which have human-readable names.

There is a special branch of Ubiq ("Documentation") which can be used to store Scenes and other assets that were set up for screenshots.
